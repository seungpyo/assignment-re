With this configuration, running npm start in the root directory will:

Build the React client.
Start the Express server (with hot-reloading).
Serve the built React app from the Express server.
Testing Changes
To ensure that changes to both the server and the client are reflected without manually rebuilding and restarting, use the development setup for the client and build the client only before deploying.

For local development:

Run the server using npm run server from the root directory.
Run the React client in development mode using npm start --prefix client.
For deployment, use the npm start script from the root directory to build the client and start the server together.

Summary
Build the React app for production using npm run build --prefix client.
Serve the React static files from the Express server.
Automate the build and start process using scripts in the root package.json.
This setup ensures that your React app is served correctly by your Express server while allowing you to develop both the server and the client efficiently.
